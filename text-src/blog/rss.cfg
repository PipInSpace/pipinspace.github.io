Very simple config for rss feed generation.
Lines begin with a "key: " and contain only one value per line in quotes.
All other entries are ignored.
These are all the valid config options:

The feed title:
title: "VioletSpace's Blog"

The blog link:
link: "https://pipinspace.github.io/blog/blog"

The blog description:
description: "My Blog. Sometimes I post here."

The location of post files:
post-link: "https://pipinspace.github.io/blog/"
